# DataCite Search

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datacite/search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datacite/search)

This is Search for metadata uploaded to DataCite's Metadata Store ([MDS](https://mds.datacite.org)).
It is based on [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/).

To learn more about DataCite please visit [our website](http://www.datacite.org)

To use this software please go to [http://search.datacite.org](https://search.datacite.org)

# Installation (for development only)

This a java servlet web application. You need a servlet container (e.g. tomcat).
You also need Maven 2.2.1 and JDK 6 in your system (OpenJDK from Ubuntu
works fine).

All dependencies are managed by Maven public repositories.

## Solr Home Directory

Solr requires a home directory to store the index and some properties.
Be aware that the user running running your servlet container must have
write access to this directory.

The content of `solr_home` has to be copied to your selected solr home directory.

All other required files will be in the war-file.

## Configure the source code

The git repository has a bunch of `*.template` files.
Those files are templates for the various configuration files which
are machine specific i.e. passwords, IP addresses etc.

To customise them you need to make a copy omitting .template from
file name.

Now in such created file you need to adjust values according to your
local environment.

### solr_home/collection1/conf/solrcore.properties

MDS database specific properties.

You will need to specify JDBC string, for example:

> jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/datacite?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF8


### src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml

Specify the path to your preliminarily chosen solr home directory by replacing `<dir>`.

### src/main/resources/log4j.xml

Your usual log4j stuff.

## Compiling

    mvn clean compile war:war

will create `target/search.war`, which is ready to be deployed.

### Running locally on your development machine

This command will run _packaged_ (i.e. not dynamic) war:

    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2048m -Xms2048m"
    mvn clean tomcat:run-war

The application can be accessed at:

> http://localhost:8080/search/public/ui

Solr admin interface is available at:

> http://localhost:8080/search

## Securing Solr

Public access should only be granted for the `/public` path.

### Configure Apache as forward proxy

    RedirectMatch ^/?$ /ui
    ProxyPassMatch ^/?$ !
    ProxyPass / ajp://localhost:<port>/search/public

# Database Requirements

The following indexes are required on the MDS database:

    create index dataset_version on metadata (dataset, metadata_version);
    create index dataset_updated on media (dataset, updated);

# Running

After deploying the following resources are of interest:

* `/public/ui` - search user interface
* `/` - admin interface

Data from MDS is imported via Solr's DataImportHandler. You can access it via admin interface.
Another option especially useful for cron jobs is `scripts/solr-client`. Simply try

    export SOLR_URL=http://localhost:8080/search
    scripts/solr-client import delta

for a delta import of MDS metadata. See `solr-client help` for usage.
